The most recent working version of our code is on the most recent commit to the demo2 branch.

The file to run to see some functionality is src/main/java/Main.java. The project can be opened in eclipse as a maven project to see the full test suite and run them as well. It is recommended to set a low number of epochs in the TrainNetwork test, or training will take several minutes.
